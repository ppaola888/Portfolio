## Javascript Functionality
**Typing Effect**

One of the effects in this project is the typing effect, implemented using the Typed.js library. This effect simulates the automatic typing of text on an HTML element, by creating a dynamic animation. In the code, a JavaScript script is used to implement the typing effect.
